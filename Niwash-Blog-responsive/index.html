                <b>Twitter</b> is the home of fast moving, up-to-the-minute content. It has regularly been the platform which has broken major news stories, like the Miracle on the Hudson. It is also a platform where not so major stories break, such as the memorable afternoon that half a million people stopped working to watch the live stream of a puddle in northern England, via <b>Twitter</b>â€™s streaming video app Periscope.

There are two ways of discovering trends on Twitter. The first is available whether you have a twitter account or not, and is called Moments. This is a curated list of the most important stories at that time, with an explanation and selected Tweets. Due to the curated nature, it is generally restricted to the biggest stories of the day.
